## Details

### Verify achievements and notes

Sentence translation for achievements and secret notes is wired up and unit-tested against the real data (`ModLogic.Tests`), but not tried live.

- Hover them in the Collections tab, including a long journal scrap for the `(...)` path.
- Or run `ls_lookup 新人牧場主`, which should give `Greenhorn (15k)`.

### Verify flashcards

Click-to-save and the pause-menu tab are built but haven't been tried live. Check:

- the tab icon's placement (left of the Inventory tab, and whether it clears the menu frame's corner) and look (a Lost Book on a menu tile, since vanilla's tab art has no blank frame)
- that suppressing the click really stops dialogue from advancing and shop rows from being bought
- the card back's layout at different UI scales
- that the ★ before a saved word's gloss renders in the hover label

### Verify GMCM hover exclusion

`HoverExclusion` turns off tooltip capture, word recording and freezing while GMCM's menu is open. It finds the menu by namespace (`GenericModConfigMenu.*`) along the active menu's child chain, or in `TitleMenu.subMenu`. Not yet tried live. Check:

- no translation box or word label in GMCM, from the title screen and from the in-game Options tab
- hover works again as soon as GMCM closes
- a tooltip locked before opening GMCM is dropped rather than drawn over it

### Verify dialogue bubble

The [dialogue translation bubble](#dialogue-translation-bubble) is built and its page mapping is unit-tested against the real tables, but it hasn't been tried live. Run `ls_dialogue` with a box open to see how it resolved. Check:

- the capture patches apply (no "Failed to patch dialogue parsing" in the log) and `ls_dialogue` shows a key and page-to-segment map for villager dialogue
- the English matches the page on screen through a multi-page conversation (`#$b#`), and on a `$q` question with its answers listed
- a `$c` line (random choice) shows the branch that was actually picked
- an inline event `speak` line resolves. `ls_dialogue` shows the event command it was captured at. If `currentCommand` has already moved past the `speak`, the ±3 search should still find it.
- a `message` box in an event, and an object dialogue (`drawObjectDialogue`) outside one
- the icon's placement on the box's top-left (not over the portrait, and clear of question boxes of any height), and that it's hidden while the box opens and closes
- that clicking the icon doesn't advance the page
- the bubble with 3+ sentences, in a small window and at a large UI scale: it should stay on screen, going below the icon when there's no room above

### Review kana long vowels

`kana-review.tsv` holds ~15k long-vowel guesses in the *older* data, which was authored romaji-first. `romaji_to_kana.py` guessed each long vowel (ō is おう or おお). They have never been reviewed, and some are known wrong (ēto came out えいと). Newer data is authored in kana and isn't affected. Do this together with [Normalise kana script](#normalise-kana-script).

### Normalise kana script

Decided 2026-09-25, rule in `tools/segment-data/README.md`: **each part in its own script.** Kanji and hiragana are read in hiragana and katakana stays katakana, so `バス停` → `バスてい`. The data breaks it widely. Of the segments mixing katakana and kanji:

| Style | Segments | Example |
|---|---|---|
| all-katakana | ~2,030 | `サイロに入れた。` → `サイロニイレタ` |
| mixed | ~850 | `インテリアを飾ることができます。` → `インテリアをカザルコトガデキマス` (only the particle is hiragana) |
| all-hiragana | ~50 | `クリスタルの木の` → `くりすたるのきの` |

The survey counted only katakana+kanji segments; kanji-only ones are unchecked. Steps:

1. Survey every segment, not just katakana+kanji ones.
2. Add the check to `validate` and `merge`.
3. Convert: each kana run takes the script of the text it reads. **Not fully mechanical.** The all-katakana readings write long vowels with `ー` (`ヤギガカエルヨーニナル`, `ドーブツ`), and in a hiragana reading `ヨー` must become `よう`, not `よー`. Whether `ー` is う or お can't be derived (どう vs とお), so those need a word list or review, like [the long-vowel review](#review-kana-long-vowels). Do the two together.

Romaji is generated from kana. Regenerate it only for segments whose kana was authored, not for the older romaji-first data (see the README).

### Consolidate redundant glosses

Review redundancy in the segment data, and consider pointing repeats at a shared glossary instead of storing a copy in every sentence. Two kinds:

- **Exact repeats.** Measured 2026-09-25: 126,307 glossed segments hold only 54,761 distinct (text, kana, gloss) triples, so ~71,500 (57%) are copies. The top ones:

  | Segment | Gloss | Copies |
  |---|---|---|
  | を | (object marker) | 3,418 |
  | は | (topic marker) | 2,801 |
  | が | (subject marker) | 2,789 |
  | の | (possessive) | 1,113 |

- **Compounds.** A sentence glosses `a b c d` as one segment, while elsewhere `ab` and `cd` each have their own gloss. That's only truly redundant when gloss(abcd) == gloss(ab) + gloss(cd). Otherwise the grouping carries meaning (an idiom, a set phrase) and must stay. Unmeasured.

**Caveat:** glosses are deliberately *in context*, so a shared entry must be keyed by sense, never by text alone. を alone has 14 distinct glosses, e.g. "(object marker)", "(along)", "(from, off)", "(path marker)", and each is correct somewhere. Some of those are the same sense spelled differently ("(object)" vs "(object marker)"). Merging those first would both shrink the data and make hover labels consistent.

**Possible shape:** a glossary file of senses `{id, text, kana, gloss}`, with segments holding a sense id where they match one and inline fields where they don't. The loader expands ids on load, so `SegmentIndex` and the concatenation invariant are unaffected.

**Weigh the gain first:** bundled JSON size, load time and memory, against a more complex authoring format (`segtool` `merge`/`validate`/`batch` and the TSV worklists all assume inline fields). The consistency gain may matter more than the size.

### Split sign markup segments

`StringsFromMaps` `BusStop.1` is `` ` バス停^> ペリカンタウン ``, where `` ` `` and `>` draw as arrow glyphs and `^` is a line break. `merge` attached them to the neighbouring words, so hovering the sign outlines `` ` バス停^ `` and `> ペリカンタウン`, arrows included.

- Split the markup into its own gloss-less segments, and check other `StringsFromMaps` signs for the same thing.
- Its kana (`バステイ`) should be `バスてい`; see [Normalise kana script](#normalise-kana-script).

### Redundant authored English

Every segment entry has an authored `english` field (all 17,255 entries in the 178 files, counted 2026-09-29), which is a literal translation written alongside the official one. The official English is already in `TranslationMap`, taken from the game's own tables. Only the flashcard back uses the authored text, where it's shown above the official "Game:" line.

In the user's words, this was "a bad oversight" and "a huge waste of resources": it was never meant to be authored separately. It's also not identical to the official text. Of the 3,277 dialogue entries whose keys are in the English tables, only 207 match once markup and whitespace are stripped.

**Consistency now matters more than fixing it.** Keep writing `english` for new entries, the same way, so the data stays uniform. Don't strip or regenerate the field, and don't make it optional in the schema.

### Optimize composite lookup

`SegmentIndex.MatchComposite` is the word-hover lookup for text the game joins from several entries (quest descriptions, clothing + `可染性。`, dialogue pages). It runs only after every other lookup misses and is memoised per drawn string. But the first frame a new string is hovered pays for it: ~40ms for the 67-char Lewis parsnip quest and ~20ms for a string that matches nothing, against the full 15k-entry index. That's a visible hitch, and it grows with text length. Costs, biggest first:

1. `LongestRunFrom` scans every key with `IndexOf` at each run start (O(positions × entries)). Replace it with an n-gram index built at load (e.g. 3-gram → entry list), or a suffix array over the keys.
2. Every position tries every length as a whole-entry lookup, allocating a substring each time (O(n²) allocations). Walk a trie of the spaceless keys instead; it gives every entry starting at a position in one pass.
3. Each position runs every template whose anchor appears in the text. Only try one where its first literal actually starts at that position.

Alternatives: precompute dialogue pages at load by splitting entries at `#$b#` / `#$e#` (see [Dialogue translation bubble](#dialogue-translation-bubble)), which moves the commonest case to an exact lookup; or run the composite off the draw thread.

### Quiet fallback log

The "fallback split" hover log fires on any text, and most of what it logged in the third session was English (GMCM labels, save names) and bare numbers (`25%`). Skip text with no Japanese characters, so every line it logs is a real gap.

### Remove debug logs

Remove the debug logging added while troubleshooting.

### Guard gendered-string splitting

Some locales have known bugs in how the game's `^` gender-variant delimiter is used. Where splitting a string on `^` gives something malformed, show no translation rather than a garbled one. There's no sign this has been done.

### Dialogue translation bubble

Built, not yet verified in game (see [Verify dialogue bubble](#verify-dialogue-bubble)). While a `DialogueBox` is open, a language icon on its top-left corner shows the page's official English in a speech bubble on hover. How it works is in `HowItWorks.md`. It departs from the original plan in two places, both simpler:

- **Page splitting records the game's parse instead of mirroring it.** `DialogueCapturePatches` watches which segments `parseDialogueString` feeds to `checkForSpecialCharacters`, and `DialoguePages` maps each page back to its raw `#` segment. Random and state-dependent branches (`$c`, `$1`, `$q`) come out right without re-evaluating them. `new Dialogue(null, null, english)` was ruled out: it advances `Game1.random`, and `%fork` sets an event flag.
- **`FromTranslation` arguments are recovered, not captured.** The `{0}` values are found by matching the Japanese template against the parsed text (`DialoguePages.TemplateArguments`), so no `FromTranslation` postfix or `ConditionalWeakTable` of arguments is needed.

Still to do:

1. **Event questions.** `question` and `quickQuestion` hold several strings in one command, and which argument is which hasn't been checked. They currently fall through to the translation map, which misses.
2. **Code-built strings.** String boxes (`drawObjectDialogue(string)`, `new DialogueBox(string)`) outside events are looked up in `TranslationMap` as a whole and page by page. That covers strings loaded whole and templates the map knows, but not text built from several `LoadString` calls. The plan for those: record `(path, args, result)` from the `LoadString` / `LoadStringReturnNullIfNotFound` overloads in a buffer cleared every tick, and have the `DialogueBox` constructor work out which recent results make up its text. `LoadString` is called constantly, so the postfix has to be cheap, and it should ignore the calls `TranslationIndex.Build` makes.
3. **Structure mismatches.** 9 of 12,400 shared entries split into a different number of `#` segments or `||` alternatives in the two locales. Three are gendered `Strings/StringsFromCSFiles` lines whose Japanese is `/`-split and whose English isn't. Those show the whole entry.
4. `$d`, `$p` and `$query` pages (45 entries) aren't mapped: those commands swap in text from inside their own segment. They fall back to the whole entry, which leaves out the command segments, so the icon can be missing on them.

Open: what a click on the icon should do, if anything (freezing the bubble, like `Z`, is the obvious candidate), and whether a held button should show the bubble for controller players. `textAboveHead` has no box, so it's out of scope.

## The pipeline

Details are in `tools/segment-data/README.md`.

```sh
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py batch <Table> 40      # worklist, TSV
# ...author a .tsv...
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py merge <Table> <file>  # align + validate
python3 tools/segment-data/kana_to_romaji.py write          # generate romaji
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py validate
```

Authoring format, one entry per line, tab-separated:

```
key <TAB> english <TAB> text¦kana¦gloss‖text¦kana¦gloss‖...
```

- Kana is the source of truth; romaji is generated. Write only the words.
- `merge` attaches punctuation and dialogue markup to a neighbouring segment, fills in kana for kanji-free segments, and rejects any line it can't line up with the source.
- Output goes to `assets/segments/ja/`, the tracked source of truth, which ships with the mod as-is.

## Done

### Language activation and sibling copies (2026-09-29)

Each copy of the mod reads its study language from the manifest's `StudyLanguage` field and runs only while the game is in that language. In any other language it has no patches, handlers or font edit, so copies for other languages can be installed alongside it. Once per launch, the title screen offers to switch to the copy's language, or asks which to study when several copies are installed. Verified in-game.

How it works, and the checklist for making a copy for another language, are in `HowItWorks.md`.

### Glyph-accurate word hover (2026-09-26)

Word hover no longer works out word positions from wrapping and font measurements. Transpilers on the game's text renderers (`SpriteText.drawString` and the four `SpriteBatch.DrawString` overloads) record where each character is actually drawn, and `GlyphHitTest` hit-tests those positions. This fixed dialogue words being detected in the wrong place after line breaks. Verified in-game.

If a game update breaks a transpiler, the SMAPI log warns about it and that renderer falls back to the old measured layout. The `Glyph capture: …` startup line shows the state of each renderer.

### Segmentation data (2026-09-25)

Every piece of Japanese text the game ships has hand-authored segment data: **15,768 entries, 10 keys deliberately skipped, 0 pending.** The live checks:

```sh
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py status     # pending=0 everywhere
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py validate   # the invariant holds
python3 tools/segment-data/segtool.py audit      # coverage vs the game install
```

`audit` checks two things:

1. **Assets:** all 207 Japanese-localized assets are covered or excluded with a reason, with no known gaps left.
2. **Text:** every Japanese character in a covered asset is held by an entry.

Run it after any game update. It fails loudly on anything new, which is what `status` could never do. `status` only measures against files somebody already chose to extract. That blind spot is how dialogue, events, festivals, TV and schedules sat unnoticed while everything read `pending=0` (see `PostMortems.md`).

How it got here, for the record:

| Entries | Source |
|---|---|
| 9,039 | every `Strings/*` table + the `Data/` record tables |
| 6,519 | the five families that were never imported (dialogue, events, festivals, TV, schedules), by a multi-agent run |
| 92 | found by `audit`'s text check: Quests completion lines (field 9), dialogue inside skipped event scripts, Lewis's phone call |
| 105 | Achievements + SecretNotes, once `XnbStringTool` learned to read `Dictionary<int,string>` |

The 10 skipped keys are event scripts the game never draws whole; their spoken lines are extracted and authored as `<key>#<n>` entries.

### Objects item names

The 756 `Objects_Name.json` entries have been hand-split into word segments. 526 multi-word names now hover per word (`アメシストの指輪` → `アメシスト` / `の` / `指輪`). The other 230 are single lexical items (one-word names, fish and mineral names, and lexicalized kanji compounds like `黒曜石`) and are deliberately left whole.
